# Introduction
The proper recording of hours performed is an important aspect of invoicing for (consultancy) companies.
With this project, we aim to simplify the process for employees to record their performances using a mobile application with geofencing and Bluetooth beacons.
A web panel will help project managers keep projects up-to-date for employees to base their time registrations on.
